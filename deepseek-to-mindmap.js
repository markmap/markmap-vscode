I want a comprehensive and visually intriguing summary of "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success" book by "Carol Dweck". It must be in a complex multi layered markdown format for maximising readability and memory boost. This markdown is going to be used in "https://markmap.js.org/" to be converted to a visually appealing mindmap. It must incorporate relevant visual elements and different structures such as tables, multi branch, emojies and icons, etc. when is contributing to the readability. 

The summary must be very comprehensive and quoting the important parts to reinforce why they are important. there must be a good balance between visual and text. 

Imagine, you don't have enough time to read the book fully, but you want to read this mind map and learn as much as possible just like someone who read the whole book, but in a shorter time.

Here is an example of the markdown formats used in the "markmap" website. You can get inspired from it and go beyond it using your creativity. Please note that the ultimate goal is to make this summary in a way that trigger visual memory and help reader to memorise it better:

## Features

Note that if blocks and lists appear at the same level, the lists will be ignored.

### Lists

- **strong** ~~del~~ *italic* ==highlight==
-\`inline code\`
- [x] checkbox
- Katex: $x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$ <!-- markmap: fold -->
  - [More Katex Examples](#?d=gist:af76a4c245b302206b16aec503dbe07b:katex.md)
- Now we can wrap very very very very long text based on \`maxWidth\` option
- Ordered list
  1. item 1
  2. item 2

### Blocks

\`\`\`js
console.log('hello, JavaScript')
\`\`\`

###Considerations:
- Avoid specifying the output with "\`\`\`markdown...\`\`\`". Only provide the final markdown.
- Avoid using mermaid flowchart or code snippet.
- Your final output must only include the markdown content without any complementary conversations.
- Please note it is absolutely fine if your output is lengthy as some books need more comprehensive details! Your summary could be up to 5000 words length!
- Remember, reader may not have any background about the book, so add concise descriptions when is necessary to enhance their understanding.
- Avoid using ">" in your markdown formatting such as: 
"""## ðŸ”¥ **Famous Quotes to Remember**  
> *"Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get."*  
> *"The person who seeks revenge should dig two graves."*
"""
